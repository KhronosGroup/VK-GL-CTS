Dear Adopters,

This announcement provides notification that the Khronos Group Inc. intends

provided by more recent releases. Once the releases are withdrawn it will not be
possible to make conformance submissions against these releases.

The Khronos Group recommends updating to Vulkan CTS 1.2.7.x and more recent releases
as early as possible.

This announcement covers the following tags as listed on
