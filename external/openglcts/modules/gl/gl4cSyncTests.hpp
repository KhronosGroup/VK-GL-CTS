/** @class SyncFlushCommandsTest
 *
 *  Description:
 *
 *      This test verifies that ClientWaitSync called with SYNC_FLUSH_COMMANDS_BIT flag
 *      behaves like Flush was inserted immediately after the creation of sync. This shall
 *      happen in finite time (OpenGL 4.5 Core Profile, Chapter 4.1.2).
 *
 *  Steps:
 *
 *      Prepare first buffer with reference data.
 *
 *      Create second buffer with null data and persistent coherent storage.
 *
 *      Map second buffer for read with persistent and coherent flags.
 *
 *      Copy first buffer to second buffer using Copy*BufferSubData function.
 *
 *      Create synchronization object using FenceSync.
 *
 *      Use ClientWaitSync, with SYNC_FLUSH_COMMANDS_BIT flag and 16 seconds timeout, to
 *      wait for synchronization being done. Check for errors - expect NO_ERROR. Expect
 *      no timeout, but if it happen return test timeout result with indication that
 *      tests possibly fails due to not returning after finite time.
 *
 *      If ClientWaitSync succeeded, compare queried data with the reference. Expect
 *      equality.
 *
 *      Unmap second buffer.
